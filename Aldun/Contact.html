                &emsp;Hello and welcome to Aldun! This is an RPG system created by Tyler Nelson with the help of friends.
                <br>We have been greatly enjoying the development of this system over time and wanted to share it with other RPG fanatics!
                Due to us wanting to develop this RPG system even further we are looking for suggestions on changes or new features!
                So!!! Thats where you come in. If you have any suggestions on what we should add to the corebook, we highly ask for suggestions!
                That being said, we do ask that if you have a new suggestion, however, we would love to see you having tried using your new mechanic in your own ark first!
                That way you are able to see any inbalances that may be presented within the new mechanic. If it all checks out, please send us an email with your suggestion.
                You can find out contact information for the Aldun team at our social Media section or our email!
                We truly do hope that you enjoy your time here in Aldun and we look forward to hearing any stories you may have along your adventures! Goodluck and happy rolling!
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have any bugs or problems/suggestions for the website as well, you can contact the creator at their email.
                <br>
